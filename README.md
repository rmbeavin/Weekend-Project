## Codebreakers

### What is Codebreakers?

* This is a REPL game built during my third week at Wyncode Academy.  This was my first attempt at using JavaScript to make a game using the CLI.

### Installation

* Clone the repository and run node newtry3.js in the command line.

### Future Additions

* Fix the second half of game to be functional
* Add more turn based options
* Convert this to a React.js project
